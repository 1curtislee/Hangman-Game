need to:
- display secret word as "_"'
- only register letters as keys pressed once game starts

-populate guessedArray[] with each letter key pressed

problems:
- guesses remaining does not display until keypress
- guesses remaining does not decrease with "--"


- functions within functions?

- github pages does not read my css or js files
